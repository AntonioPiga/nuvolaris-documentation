== Storing the Message in the Database

We are ready to use the database that we enabled at the beginning of the tutorial.

Since we are using a relational database, we need to create a table to store the contact data. We can do that by creating a new action called `create-table.js` in the `packages/contact` folder:

[source,javascript]
----
const { Client } = require('pg')

async function main(args) {
    const client = new Client({ connectionString: args.dbUri });

    const createTable = `
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS contacts (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        name varchar(50),
        email varchar(50),
        phone varchar(50),
        message varchar(300)
    );
    `
    // Connect to database server
    await client.connect();

    try {
        await client.query(createTable)
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
        throw e
    } finally {
        client.end();
    }
}
----

We just need to run this once, therefore it doesn't need to be a web action. Here we can take advantage of the `cron` service we enabled! 

With the cron scheduler you can annotate an action with 2 kinds of labels. One to make Nuvolaris periodically invoke the action, the other to automatically execute an action once, on creation.

Let's create the action with the latter, which means annotating the action with `autoexec true`:

[source,bash]
----
nuv action create contact/create-table create-table.js -a autoexec true
ok: created action contact/create-table
----

With `-a` you can add "annotations" to an action. Nuvolaris will invoke this action as soon as possible, so we can go on.

====

In Nuvolaris an action invocation is called an `activation`. You can keep track, retrieve information and check logs from an action with `nuv activation`. For example, with:

[source,bash]
----
nuv activation list
----

You can retrieve the list of invocations. For caching reasons the first time you run the command the list might be empty. Just run it again and you will see the latest invocations (probably some `hello` actions from the deployment).

If we want to make sure `create-table` was invoked, we can do it with this command. The cron scheduler can take up to 1 minute to run an `autoexec` action, so let's wait a bit and run `nuv activation list` again.

[source,bash]
----
nuv activation list

Datetime            Activation ID                    Kind      Start Duration   Status  Entity
2023-10-02 09:52:01 1f02d3ef5c32493682d3ef5c32b936da nodejs:18 cold  312ms      success nuvolaris/create-table:0.0.1
...
----

Each activation has an `Activation ID` which can be used with other `nuv activation` subcommands or with the `nuv logs` command.

=== The Action to Store the Data

We could just write the code to insert data into the table in the `submit.js` action, but it's better to have a separate action for that. Let's create a new file called `write.js` in the `packages/contact` folder:

[source,javascript]
----
const { Client } = require('pg')

async function main(args) {
    const client = new Client({ connectionString: args.dbUri });

    // Connect to database server
    await client.connect();

    const { name, email, phone, message } = args

    try {
        await client.query(
            'INSERT INTO contacts(name,email,phone,message) VALUES($1,$2,$3,$4)',
            [name, email, phone, message]
        )
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
        throw e
    } finally {
        client.end();
    }
}
----

Very similar to the create table action, but this time we are inserting data into the table by passing the values as parameters. Let's deploy it:

[source,bash]
----
nuv action create contact/write write.js
ok: created action contact/write
----

=== Finalizing the Submit Action

Alright, we are almost done. We just need to add the code to invoke the `write` action to store the data. We can do that by adding a small function inside the `submit.js` action:

[source,javascript]
----
var openwhisk = require('openwhisk')

function save(doc) {
  var ow = openwhisk({api_key: process.env.__OW_API_KEY})
  return ow.actions.invoke({
    "name": "contact/write",
    "params": {
      "name": doc.name,
      "email": doc.email,
      "phone": doc.phone,
      "message": doc.message
    }
  })
}
...
----

Add that above the `main` function. What we are doing here is importing the special `openwhisk` module that gives you access to the Openwhisk API (the Nuvolaris' serverless engine) from within any action. 

To construct the `ow` object you need to pass the API key, which you can get as an environment variable when annotating the action with a special value.

Now we can replace that last TODO with a call to the `save` function:

[source,javascript]
----
save({
      "name": args.name,
      "email": args.email,
      "phone": args.phone,
      "message": args.message
    })
----

Let's update the action with the new code and the special annotation:

[source,bash]
----
nuv action update contact/submit submit.js --web true -a provide-api-key true
ok: updated action contact/submit
----

As before with `autoexec` we are adding an annotation, but this time it's to instruct the platform to inject the api key as an env var in the function's environment, so we have access to it in the code.

Now the pipeline is complete, and we can test it by submitting the form again. This time the data will be stored in the database.
