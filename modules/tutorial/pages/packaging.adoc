== Packaging the App

=== Scan the Project

We developed the project with a clear structure:

[source,bash]
----
----
----
<!DOCTYPE <html>

<head>
   <link href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" id="bootstrap-css">
</head>

<body>
   <div id="container">
      <div class="row">
         <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h4>Get in Touch</h4>
            <form method="POST">
               <div class="form-group">
                  <input type="text" name="name" class="form-control" placeholder="Name">
               </div>
               <div class="form-group">
                  <input type="email" name="email" class="form-control" placeholder="E-mail">
               </div>
               <div class="form-group">
                  <input type="tel" name="phone" class="form-control" placeholder="Phone">
               </div>
               <div class="form-group">
                  <textarea name="message" rows="3" class="form-control" placeholder="Message"></textarea>
               </div>
               <button class="btn btn-default" type="submit" name="button">
                  Send
               </button>
            </form>
         </div>
      </div>
   </div>
</body>

</html>

Now we just have to upload it to our Nuvolaris deployment. You could upload it using something like `curl` with a `PUT` to where your platform is deployed at, but there is an handy command that does it automatically for all files in a folder:

[source,bash]
----
nuv web upload web/
----

Pass to `nuv web upload` the path to folder where the index.html is stored in (the `web` folder if you followed the tutorial) and visit again the `<apihost>`. 

Now you should see the new index page:

=== The Contact Package 

The contact form we just uploaded does not do anything. To make it work let's start by creating a new package to hold our actions, furthermore, we can bind to this package the database url, so the actions can directly access it!

With the debug command you can see what's going on in your deployment. This time let's use   it to grab the "postgres_url" value:

[source,bash]
----
nuv debug status | grep postgres_url
----

Copy the Postgres URL (something like `postgresql://...`). Now we can create a new package for the application:

[source,bash]
----
nuv package create contact -p dbUri <postgres_url>
ok: created package contact
----

The actions under this package will be able to access the "dbUri" variable from their args!

To follow the same structure for our action files, let's create a folder `packages` and inside another folder `contact` to give our actions a nice, easy to find, home.
