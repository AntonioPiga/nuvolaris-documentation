= Tutorial

This tutorial walks you through developing a simple Nuvolaris application 
using the Command Line Interface (CLI) and Javascript (but any supported language will do).

Its purpose is to showcase serverless development in action by creating a contact form for a website.
We will see the development process from start to finish, including the deploying of the platform and running the application.
