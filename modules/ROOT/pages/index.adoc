== Bug Bounty

The installer already passes https://github.com/nuvolaris/nuvolaris-testing/actions[all the tests] in our supported platforms and the installation documentation is complete.

So if you feel brave, it is time to try to install it.

== Installation successful?

If your installation is successful, report it in our forum, and we will invite you to https://nuvolaris.discourse.group/t/install-nuvolaris-and-join-us-at-the-install-party/74[join us at the *Install Party*]!

We are organizing an Install Party live, and will invite all those who reported a successful installation https://nuvolaris.discourse.group/[in our forum]!

## Installation fails???

If your installation fails, please https://bit.ly/nuvbugs[file a bug], and we will thank you.

We have 10 copies of our book [Learning Apache OpenWhisk](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Apache-OpenWhisk-Developing-Serverless/dp/1492046167), the serverless engine that is the foundation of Nuvolaris.

We will make a gift of a copy of the book to whose who will give us significant help in fixing the bugs with useful and reproducible bug reports.
