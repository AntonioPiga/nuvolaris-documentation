* Learn xref:installation.adoc[how to install Nuvolaris].
* Learn https://openwhisk.apache.org/documentation.html[how to develop with Nuvolaris] using OpenWhisk documentation.
* Read  https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Apache-OpenWhisk-Developing-Serverless-ebook/dp/B07TYSXWNN[a book on Apache OpenWhisk] written by one of the authors of OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris.

*NOTE*: the Apache OpenWhisk documentation used the `wsk` tool, that  is embedded as a subcommand in the `nuv` tool. If you use Nuvolaris,  whenever you see `wsk` you should use `nuv wsk` instead.

In alternative you can add to your `.bashrc` the following:

----
alias wsk='nuv wsk'
----

So when you type `wsk` it will use `nuv wsk`.
