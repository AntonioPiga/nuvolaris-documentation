= Configuring DNS 

 You can give a fixed DNS name to your server, but you can also give a wildcard DNS name, and you are advised to do so, even if the setup is more complex. Wildcard DNS is used to provision multiple front-end to your serverless apps.

[#dns]
== DNS

Get the IP of the server with:

----
nuv TODO
----

configure a record to this IP in your DNS server

----
nuv config apihost <server>
----

[#wildcard]
== DNS Wildcard

Use a wildcard for statics `*`
