= Prerequisites to install Nuvolaris in an Google GKE Cluster

https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine[Google GKE] is a pre-built Kubernetes cluster offered by the cloud provider https://cloud.google.com/gcp[Google Cloud Platform].

You can create an AKS Cluster in Microsoft Azure for installing using Nuvolaris using xref:download.adoc[nuv] as follows:

. install the <<install-cli, Azure CLI>>
. <<get-credentials, ling >>
. <<configure, configure AKS>>
. <<provision, provision AKS>>
. optionally, retrieve the <<retrieve-lb, load balancer address>> to configure a DNS name

Once you have AKS up and running you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring] and xref:install-cluster.adoc[installing Nuvolaris].
