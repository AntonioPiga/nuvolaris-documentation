= Configuring Nuvolaris Installation

This section guides to configuring the nuvolaris installation.

You an install without configuration when performing:

* a xref:local.adoc[local] installation when Docker Desktop is available;
* a xref:server.adoc[server] installation when a server is accessible with ssh;
* a xref:cluster.adoc[cluster] installation when a cluster is accessible with a kubeconfig.

In this case you install a minimal Nuvolaris:

* only the serverless engine, no extra services
* accessibile only in `http`.

You can configure:

* a custom xref:index-config-ssldns#dns[DNS name] or a xref:index-config-ssldns#wildcard[DNS wildcard] for statics.
* activate xref:index-config-ssldns#ssl[https] with a certificate deployed with https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt].
* activate various integrated xref:index-config-services.adoc[services]: xref:index-config-services.adoc#redis[REDIS], xref:index-config-services.adoc#postgres[Postgres] and xref:index-config-services.adoc#minio[MinIO].
