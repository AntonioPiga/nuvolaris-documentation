== Installing Docker Desktop

You can install Nuvolaris in you local machine.

You need a computer with at least 12 GB of memory, better 16GB. _8GB are definitely **not enough** to run Nuvolaris in your local machine_.

You need also to install https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop].

=== Memory Requisites

On Mac, you need also to reserve al least 6GB (better 8GB) of memory to Docker Desktop, since the default is not enough. 

This is a required step for Mac, but not on Windows and Mac.

On Mac you should:

* select Preferences
* click on Resources
* _increase the memory up to 6GB_
* click on `Apply & Restart`
