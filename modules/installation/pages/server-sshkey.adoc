= Generate an SSH key

To connect to a server you need a couple of file called **ssh keys**


You can generate them on command line using

----
ssh-keygen
----

It will create a couple of files, typically called:

* ~/.ssh/id_rsa
* ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

You have to keep secret the `id_rsa` file, while you can copy the `id_rsa.pub` file and install in the server to access it.

See xref:server-generic.adoc[here] for informations how to install it in a server.
