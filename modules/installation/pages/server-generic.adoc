= Installing Public SSH key

Once you got your `id_rsa.pub` and a server, get access to it.

The exact instructions depends on the specific provider.

== Generic instructions.

The generic instructions are the following:

* Usually you will be given an IP address and a password.
* Using those informations you will be able to enter in the server, edit the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and  add your `id_rsa.pub` 
* if you are using a non-root user, ensure this user has the right to use `sudo` to run commands as a root without a password. 
* ti give sudo rights to a non-root user, usually you need to use the root password, then edit the file /etc/sudoers and add the line:

----
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
----

(change `<user>` with your actual user).
