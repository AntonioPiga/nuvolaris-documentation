= Provisioning a Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes clusters are available from a variety of vendors.

Each vendor will provision one with specific requirements then it will give you a file calles `kubeconfig` that should be placed under `~/.kube/config` to access the cluster.

The tool `nuv` includes automated provisioning in the following enviroments:

* xref:cluster-eks.adoc[Amazon AKS]
* xref:cluster-aks.adoc[Azure AKS]
* xref:cluster-gke.adoc[Google GKE]

If your cluster is not one of those, contact your provider for informations how to get the `kubeconfig`.
