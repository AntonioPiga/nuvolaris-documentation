= Provisioning a Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes clusters are available from a variety of vendors.

Each vendor will provision one with specific requirements then it will give you a file called `kubeconfig` that should be placed under `~/.kube/config` to access the cluster.

The tool `nuv` includes automated provisioning in the following environments:

* xref:prereq-eks.adoc[Amazon AKS]
* xref:prereq-aks.adoc[Azure AKS]
* xref:prereq-gke.adoc[Google GKE]

If your cluster is not one of those, contact your provider for information on how to get the `kubeconfig`.
