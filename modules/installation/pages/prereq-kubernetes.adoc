= Prerequisites to install Nuvolars in a Kubernetes cluster

You can install Nuvolaris in any Kubernetes cluster which xref:prereq-cluster.adoc[satisfy some requirements].

You can provision a suitable cluster by yourself, in any cloud or on premises. Once provisioned, you will receive a configuration file to access the cluster, called `kubeconfig` and usually placed in `~/.kube/config`. If you have this file, you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring the installation] and then


Kubernetes clusters pre-built  are available from a variety of cloud providers. We provide with our `nuv` the commands to install a Kubernetes cluster ready to use 



The tool `nuv` includes automated provisioning in the following environments:

* xref:prereq-eks.adoc[Amazon AKS]
* xref:prereq-aks.adoc[Azure AKS]
* xref:prereq-gke.adoc[Google GKE]

If your cluster is not one of those, contact your provider for information on how to get the `kubeconfig`.
