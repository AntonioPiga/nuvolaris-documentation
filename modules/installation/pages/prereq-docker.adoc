== Installing Docker Desktop

You can install Nuvolaris in you local machine.

You need a computer with at least 16 GB of memory. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
8GB are definitely **not enough** to run Nuvolaris in your local machine.
====

You need also to install https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop].

=== Memory Requisites

On Mac, you need also to reserve al least 6GB (better 8GB) of memory to Docker Desktop, since the default is not enough. 

This is a required step for Mac, but not on Windows and Linux.

On Mac you should:

* click on the Docker Desktop icon
* select Preferences
* click on Resources
* _increase the reserved memory up to (at least) 6GB_
* click on `Apply & Restart`
