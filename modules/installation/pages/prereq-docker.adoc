= Installing Nuvolaris with Docker

You can install Nuvolaris on your local machine using Docker.

You need a computer with at least 16 GB of memory. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
8GB are definitely **not enough** to run Nuvolaris on your local machine.
====

Furthermore, you need Docker. Let's see the requiremnts for installing on:

* <<windows, Windows>>
* <<macos, MacOS>>
* <<linux, Linux>>

[#windows]
== Installing Docker on Windows

Download and install https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop] for Windows.

[#macos]
== Installing Docker on Linux

On Mac, you need also to reserve at least 6GB (better 8GB) of memory to Docker Desktop, since the default is not enough. 

This is a required step for Mac, but not on Windows and Linux.

On Mac, you should:

* click on the Docker Desktop icon
* select Preferences
* click on Resources
* _increase the reserved memory up to (at least) 6GB_
* click on `Apply & Restart`
