Nuvolaris Documentation
========================

Nuvolaris is a distribution of Apache OpenWhisk.

It includes an [all-in-one CLI]https://github.com/nuvolaris/nuvolaris/releases that manages both installation on Kubernetes and development.

- [Installation](Installation.md)
- [Development](https://openwhisk.apache.org/documentation.html)

**NOTE**: standard Apache OpenWhisk documentation refers to the `wsk` tool, that is embedded in the `nuv` tool, so whenever you see `wsk` you should use `nuv wsk` instead.
